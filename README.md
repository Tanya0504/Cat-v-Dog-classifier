# Cat-v-Dog-classifier

This is a deep-learning-based classifier that distinguishes between cats and dogs. Why? Because I love cats, and they deserve the best AI recognition possible (Dogs, you’re cool too, I guess)


## 🧠 How It Works  
Using machine learning magic, this model takes an image and tells you if it’s a cat or a dog. Built with:  
**TensorFlow/Keras** – for training our model like a pet whisperer  
 **Image Processing** – because raw images need some TLC before going to the model  
 **Evaluation Metrics** – to see just how good our classifier is  


## 📈 Model Performance  
- Accuracy: **89%**  
- Cat Recognition: **Purrrfect 🐾**  
- Dog Recognition: **Woof-derful 🐕**
